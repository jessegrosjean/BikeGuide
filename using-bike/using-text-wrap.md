# Using Text Wrap

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/TextWrap.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Text wrap adds margins</p></figcaption></figure>

Text wrap limits the number of characters that your outline uses until the text wraps to the next line. When text is wrapping any extra margins are added to keep the text places nicely in the window. You can see text wrap in effect in the above screenshot.

Text wrap will also scale your document to fit large windows. For example if you have text wrap enabled and then enter [fullscreen mode](using-full-screen-mode.md) you'll notice that the text is scalled larger to better fit your screen.
