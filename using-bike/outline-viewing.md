# Outline Viewing

Bike has two great ways to view big outlines:

1. Collapse rows to see the big picture without being distracted by the details
2. Focus in to work on the details without being distracted by everything else

#### To collapse rows in your outline

![Collapse](../.gitbook/assets/Folding.png)

*   Outline > Expand Row (`Command-0`)

    Expand selected row.
*   Outline > Collapse Row (`Command-9`)

    Collapse selected row.
* Outline > Expand Row Completely (`Control-Command-0`)\
  Expand the selected row and all rows that it contains. See all contained rows.
* Outline > Collapse Row Completely (`Control-Command-9`)\
  Collapse the selected row and all rows that it contains. This is a nice way to clean up a view, when you next expand the row its contained rows will still be collapsed.
*   Outline > Expand All (`Control-Command-0`)

    Expand all top level rows.
*   Outline > Collapse All (`Control-Command-9`)

    Collapse all top level rows.
*   Outline > Expand All by Level (`Shift-Command-0`)

    Find the minimum level that is collapsed. Expand all rows at that level.
*   Outline > Collapse All by Level (`Shift-Command-9`)

    Find the maximum level that is expanded. Collapse all rows at that level.

#### To focus into your outline

![Focus In](../.gitbook/assets/Focusing.png)

* Go > Focus In (`Option-Command-Right`)
* Go > Focus Out (`Option-Command-Left`)
* Go > Focus Headingâ€¦ (`Command-P`) to quickly select and focus a heading.&#x20;

In [Outline Editing](outline-editing.md) mode you can use arrow keys to expand and collapse rows.
