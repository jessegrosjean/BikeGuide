# Bike Compatible Apps

Bike supports three file formats `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` as described in [Using Documents](using-bike/using-documents.md). Each is what I would describe as an "open" file format, a format for structured data that is already supported by other applications.

The OPML format in particular is a [common standard](http://opml.org) for outlines. If you want to share outlines with another app OPML is likely your best bet.

This list welcome your feedback, additions, results, and notes. I have made this list by  searching and reading product pages and release notes. Some things may be out of date or just untrue. Please let me know what needs fixing!

* [Bike (macOS)](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) – Bike can read and write `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` directly to the file system as a supported file format. It can also read/write those formats to the clipboard.
* [Checkvist (Web)](https://checkvist.com) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [Drummer (Web + Electron)](http://drummer.scripting.com) – Uses OPML as native format. Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike.
* [Dynalist (Web)](https://dynalist.io) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, many need formatting cleanup.
* [iThoughtsX (macOS, iOS, Windows)](https://www.toketaware.com) – Import OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
