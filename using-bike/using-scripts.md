# Using Scripts

Use scripts to automate Bike and integrate with other apps. You can find existing Bike scripts on Bike's [extension wiki](https://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/bike-extensions-wiki/4810). This section shows how to run scripts that someone else has written. If you want to create your own scripts please see the [Creating Scripts](../customizing-bike/creating-scripts.md) section.

#### To try a script:

1. Open the "Script Editor" application that comes with your Mac.
2. Paste the following script into a new editor window.
3. Make sure that the scripting language is set to "AppleScript". (Use `View > Show Navigation Bar` if no language selector is displayed at the top left of the document).
4. Press the "Play" button to run the script. This script will create a new document named "Testing!". It deletes any welcome text that may be inserted into the document. Then it adds a "Hello" row to the document that contains a "World" row.

```
tell application "Bike"
  tell (make document with properties {name:"Testing!"})
    delete every row -- remove any welcome text
    tell (make row with properties {name:"Hello"})
      make row with properties {name:"World"}
    end tell
  end tell
end tell
```

#### **To test a script given to you by someone else:**

I recommend that you first close your documents and create a new test document before running the script. You want to be sure that the script does what you want it to do, before you run it on your real work!

**To install a script in the system script menu:**

Open Script Editor and choose Help > Script Editor Help. Search for the help section "Access your scripts using the Script menu". That will lead you through the steps of enabling and saving scripts into the system script menu.

You can also use [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) or [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) to run your scripts with assigned keyboard shortcuts.
