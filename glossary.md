# Glossary

When describing an outline it's common to use the following terms:

* _Branch_: A branch consists of an row together with all the rows that it contains. The row's children, the children's children, etc.
* _Child_: The children of an row are the rows that it directly contains
* _Handle_: The triangle to the left of each row&#x20;
* _Parent_: The parent of a row is the row that directly contains it
* _Root_: The topmost row in an outline is the root row. The root isn't visible, instead the top level visible rows in Bike are children of this hidden root row.
* _Sibling_: All children that have the same parent row are siblings
