# Using Shortcuts

Shortcuts[^1] are a new automation technology available on Apple platforms.

They are similar in capability to AppleScript, but easier to get started with and actively developed by Apple. They are the new automation thing.

You can use shortcuts with Bike on macOS 13 and later. Find Bike specific shortcuts on the [extension wiki](https://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/bike-extensions-wiki/4810). If you want to create your own shortcuts see [Creating Shortcuts](../customizing-bike/creating-shortcuts.md). This post introduces[ shortcuts in Bike](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/bike-automate-with-shortcuts/).

[Apple's macOS shortcuts documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts-mac/apdf22b0444c/mac) teaches you how to run shortcuts, place then in your menu bar, assign _keyboard shortcuts_, and more.

[^1]: These are not the same as _keyboard shortcuts_.
