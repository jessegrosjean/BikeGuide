# Outline Viewing

Bike has two great ways to view big outlines:

1. Collapse rows to see the big picture without being distracted by the details
2. Focus in to work on the details without being distracted by everything else

#### To collapse rows in your outline

![Collapse](../.gitbook/assets/Folding.png)

* Collapse Row (`Command-9`)
* Expand Row (`Command-0`)
* Collapse All (`Control-Command-9`)\
  Collapse the selected row and all rows that it contains. This is a nice way to clean up a view, when you next expand the row its contained rows will still be collapsed.
* Expand All (`Control-Command-0`)\
  Expand the selected row and all rows that it contains. See all contained rows.

#### To focus into your outline

![Focus In](../.gitbook/assets/Focusing.png)

* Focus In (`Option-Command-Right`)
* Focus Out (`Option-Command-Left`)

In [Outline Editing](outline-editing.md) mode you can use arrow keys to expand and collapse rows.
