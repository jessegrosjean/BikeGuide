* Use the menu item File > New Window (`Option-Command-N`)
* Each window maintains its own selection, focused row, and expanded row.

### Bike Window Restoration

macOS has a standard feature that saves windows when you quit an application and restores them next time you open the application.

To have your windows restored you need to make sure that Bike doesn't close windows before it quits. There is a system setting for this "Close windows when quitting an app", but I have found that many users want to use a separate setting for Bike, without changing there system setting.

Bike no longer uses the system setting. Instead to leave windows open when quitting Bike you should open Settings > Document. And then make sure that "When quitting Bike: Close documents" is _not_ checked. After you've done that then Bike should restore your open windows and the focused row, collapsed rows, and the selection.
