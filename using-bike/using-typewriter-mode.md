# Using Typewriter Mode

Typewriter Mode centers your text caret vertically in the window as you type. This keeps the text you are working on, and surrounding text, easily visible. It's especially useful combined with [full screen mode](using-full-screen-mode.md) and [focus mode](using-focus-mode.md).

#### To enable typewriter mode

* View > Typewriter Mode > Enable Typewriter (`Option-Command-T`)
* Alternatively you can use the "Options" menu on the left side of the status bar

#### To configure typewriter mode

Typewriter mode centers your text caret by default. You can also choose "top" or "bottom" to have typewriter mode position your cursor nearer the top or bottom of the window.

* View > Typewriter Mode > Typewriter Top
* View > Typewriter Mode > Typewriter Center
* View > Typewriter Mode > Typewriter Bottom

#### To disable typewriter mode

* View > Typewriter Mode > Disable Typewriter (`Option-Command-T`)
* Alternatively you can use the "Options" menu on the left side of the status bar
