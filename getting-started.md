Bike: Tool for thought
{% endembed %}

Bike is an outliner.&#x20;

Indent to create a structured outline. Fold this outline to hide details. Focus your outline to see specifics. Use your outline to track ideas, projects, writing, to-do lists. More generally outliners are great _tools for thought_.

#### To create a row

* Press the `Return` key to create a row

#### To change a row's indentation level

* Press the `Tab` key to indent a row
* Press `Shift-Tab` key to unindent a row

#### To show and hide detail in your outline

* Click a row's triangle handle to collapse the row, hiding its contained rows
* Click that same handle to expand the row, showing its contained rows

#### To focus into a specific part of your outline, hiding everything else

* Command-Click a rows's handle or (`Option-Command-Right`)
* Command-Click on a focused rows's handle to unfocus it or (`Option-Command-Left`)

**To format text in your outline**

* Show the formatting popover with `Command-K`
* Select formatting options from the popover with your mouse or with the single letter keyboard shortcuts displayed on the panel.

That's it, just a few commands. Internalize these commands. _Learn the keyboard shortcuts_. Once you've done that Bike will be a great place for you to think.
