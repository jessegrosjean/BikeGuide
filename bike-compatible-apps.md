# Bike Compatible Apps

Bike supports three file formats `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` as described in [Using Documents](using-bike/using-documents.md). Each is what I would describe as an "open" file format, a format for structured data that is already supported by other applications.

The OPML format in particular is a [common standard](http://opml.org) for outlines. If you want to share outlines with another app OPML is likely your best bet. Here is a list of [OPML compatible apps](http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml) on the opml.org website.

#### Bike Compatible Apps

This list welcome your feedback, additions, results, and notes. I have made this list by  searching and reading product pages and release notes. Some things may be out of date or just untrue. Please let me know what needs fixing!

* [Bike (macOS)](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) – Bike can read and write `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` directly to the file system as a supported file format. It can also read/write those formats to the clipboard.
* [Checkvist (Web)](https://checkvist.com) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [Drummer (Web + Electron)](http://drummer.scripting.com) – Uses OPML as native format. The Electron version saves OPML directly to disk so you can work on the same file with Bike and Drummer without import/export. Both the web and Electron versions support import and export of OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike.
* [Dynalist (Web)](https://dynalist.io) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, many need formatting cleanup.
* [iThoughtsX (macOS, iOS, Windows)](https://www.toketaware.com) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [LittleOutliner (Web)](http://littleoutliner.com) – Uses OPML as native format. Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike.
* [Logseq (Electron)](https://logseq.com) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [Mellel (macOS + iOS)](https://www.mellel.com/) – Import and export OPML. A multilingual word processor which assigns different formatting styles to each outline level.
* [MindNode (macOS + iOS)](https://www.mindnode.com) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike.
* [OmniOutliner (macOS + iOS)](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) – Import and export OPML. I think it can also use OPML as a standard document format (meaning no import export required). I think you can share an OPML document on iCloud and edit on iOS with OmniOutliner and on macOS with Bike. I have not tested this.
* [OutlineEdit (macOS)](https://outlineedit.com/index.html) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup
* [Outlinely (macOS + iOS)](https://glamdevelopment.com/outlinely) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [Outliner (iOS)](https://carbonfin.com) – Uses OPML as its native document format. I think you can share an OPML document on iCloud and edit on iOS with Outliner and on macOS with Bike. I have not tested this.
* [WorkFlowy (Web + iOS + Electron)](https://workflowy.com/) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
* [Zavala (macOS + iOS)](https://zavala.vincode.io) – Import and export OPML. Copy and paste outlines with Bike, may need formatting cleanup.
